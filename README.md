This project includes all security best practices in the SDLC. Security tools that we are going to use in this project are:
Gitleaks (SAST, Credential scanning)
Sonarqube (SAST)
Owasp Zap (DAST)
Owasp Dependancy (Scan dependancies)
Trivy (Scan Docker Images)

CI/CD - Github actions
CSP - AWS
Containerization - Docker, k8s
Notification - Email, slack

This application is vulneralble by intent, to make sure our scanning is working properly.
